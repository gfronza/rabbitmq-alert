About RabbitMQ Alert
====================

Send notifications when predefined conditions are met.

Which conditions?
=================

- Ready messages
- Unacknowledged messages
- Total queued messages
- Number of connected consumers
- Number of nodes running
- Memory used by each node in MBs

My inspiration to create this notification sender is to monitor a set of Celery workers. Sometimes they stop working and monitoring
the queue size seems to be an easy way to know when these situations happen. Additionally, automatically monitoring the queue sizes
is a great way to scale up/down the number of workers.

What type of notifications?
===========================

Currently the following are supported:

- E-mails
- Slack messages
- Telegram messages

Installation
============

For now you have to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/gfronza/rabbitmq-alert.git
```

Usage
=====

Execute with options
--------------------

You can execute ```rabbitmq-alert``` along using the provided options, but first take a look at ```--help``` to see whats available
and the purpose of each option.

Example:

```
./rabbitmq-alert.py \
    --host=my-server --port=55672 --username=guest --password=guest \
    --vhost=%2F --queue=my_queue1,my_queue2 --ready-queue-size=3 --check-rate=300 \
    --email-to=admin@example.com --email-from=admin@example.com \
    --email-subject="RabbitMQ alert at %s - %s" --email-server=localhost
```

Execute with a configuration file
---------------------------------

Alternatively, you can use a configuration file which is a lot cleaner. For the required format, take a look
at the ```example.ini``` file contained in the project.

Then execute ```rabbitmq-alert``` with the configuration file option:

```
./rabbitmq-alert.py -c my_config.ini
```

You can also define queue specific conditions in the configuration file, in case you want to have fine-tuned options for each queue.
Just create a ```[Conditions]``` section for each queue. Example:

```
[Conditions:my-queue]
...

[Conditions:my-other-queue]
...
```

Note that queue names also have to be defined in the ```[Server]``` section of the configuration file:

```
[Server]
...
queues=my-queue,my-other-queue
...
```

Contribute
==========

The project ```rabbitmq-alert``` is written in ```python2```.
Of course, you can contribute to the project. Take a look at the GitHub "Issues" page and pick an issue to implement / fix.
Fork the project, develop and then create a pull request, in order for your code to be added to the project.

Prepare your environment
------------------------

To start, you have to install the dev dependencies which are some required python packages:

```
make deps-dev
```

Run the tests!
--------------

After writing your awesomeness, run the test suites to ensure that everything is still fine:

```
make test
```

Do add tests yourself for the code you contribute to ensure the quality of the project.

Happy coding :-)
